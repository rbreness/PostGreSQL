#IN THIS SQL CODE, I'M ANALYSING A CITY'S BIKE LANE DATABASE
#1 Created a list of all the bike lanes that have an average safety rating of 4.0 or higher. 
Table includes average safety rating for each of those bike lanes labled as "Safe Lane".
WITH safety_average_cte AS (
  SELECT street, AVG(safetyrating) as 'rating'
   FROM citybikelanes
   GROUP BY street
)
SELECT 
street,
rating,
'Safe Lane' as 'label'
FROM safety_average_cte
  WHERE rating >=4

#2 Created a list of all the bike lanes with the safety ratings and the average safety rating for each lane. 
Bike lanes with a 4 or more were labeled "Leave As-Is".
Bike lanes with an average safety rating of less than 2.5 were labeled as "Remove".
All other bike lanes were labeled as "Improvements Needed".
SELECT street, safetyrating,
AVG(safetyrating) OVER(PARTITION BY street) AS "Average_safety_rating",
   CASE
       WHEN AVG(safetyrating) OVER(PARTITION BY street) >=4 THEN "Leave As-Is"
       WHEN AVG(safetyrating) OVER(PARTITION BY street) <2.5 THEN "Remove"
       ELSE "Improvements Needed"
   END AS recommendation
